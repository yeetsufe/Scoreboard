# Scoreboard

A Java program that grabs a file containing the leaderboard of a game, then outputs all players that share a given power in alphabetical order or outputs the player containing a given name depending on the user's choice. This program was created to demonstrate the use of the java.utils.Collections class and Comparator interface, along with their various features such as sorting a data structure class or performing binary search operations.

Note: This program is written such that the conditionals prevent anything from occuring if the leaderboard.txt file is left blank. To see the program in operation, simply fill some lines in the txt file in the following format:

[Score (integer value)] [Name (can include spaces)] [Power (must be one word with no spaces)]
